# How to use this template

Use this template to create a new website with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and the NIU theme, by choosing the "Use this template" button when creating a new repository.

You can keep track of the changes applied to the template by adding it as a secondary remote to your local repository. In this way, you can pull the latest changes from the template and merge them into your repository.
